	<h2>The effects of the warm up and cool down process</h2>
	<span>Training should be considered to be a very deliberate and controlled process, following precise guidelines. One of those guidelines is that every session starts with a warm up and ends with a cool down. Specific training methods are used to bring about specific outcomes and even the timing and order of when to use each training method can be planned to the finest detail.</span>

	<h2>
		The different methods of training
	</h2>
	<p style="color: blue;"><b>Continuous training develops cardiovascular fitness</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A minimum of 20 minutes sub-maximal work.</li>
		<li>Target heart rate range between 60% - 80% maximum heart rate (maxHR).</li>
		<li>Swimming, running, cycling, walking or a combination of these disciplines.</li>
		<li>Disadvantage - some participants find longer sessions to be boring.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="color: blue;><b>Interval training develops strength, speed and muscular endurance</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Periods of intense work interspersed with timed rest.</li>
		<li>A wide variety of fitness types can be developed.</li>
		<li>Structured in reps and sets.</li>
		<li>Intensity is measured by % maxHR.</li>
		<li>Disadvantage - maximal nature of intervals can be too challenging for some participants.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="font-family: helvetica;color: blue"><b>Weight training develops strength</b></p>
	<ul>

		<li style="font-family: helvetica;">An interval form of training.</li>
		<li style="font-family: helvetica;">Intensity is measured in a percentage of the most weight a person can lift one time and is known as % 1 REP MAX.</li>
		<li style="font-family: helvetica;">Time is structured in reps and sets with specific timings for recovery between sets.</li>
		<li style="font-family: helvetica;">Huge range of possible lifts combining machines, free weights and body weight exercises.</li>
		<li style="font-family: helvetica;">Disadvantage - many performers use poor technique while striving for an even heavier weight.</li>
	</ul>

<p style="font-family: helvetica; color: blue"><b>Factors affecting training</b></p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica; ">The choice of how to train can be affected by many factors. Some training methods such as weight training require the use of some specialist equipment whereas others such as interval training do not. Therefore the availability of facilities is relevant.

<p style="font-family: helvetica;">Some training methods can also be very high impact and are less advisable for some groups in society such as children or elderly people. Plyometrics is a very effective method of developing explosive power but should not be used with a child that is growing or a performer who is overweight or less fit. The high impacts can prove damaging to joints and muscles unless the performer is in peak condition.</p>
